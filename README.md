# the TRUTH

## Concept

The TRUTH is an UFO database site. Upon going to the site, you will be asked if you would like to report the TRUTH or find the TRUTH. If the user chooses report they will be taken to a form to complete with information on their alien encounter. Upon submitting, the information that the user enters will be added to the alien enounters database. If they choose find the user will be take to a page to enter search parameters for the alien encounters they would like to locate. They results will then be displayed on  table. From that table they can then choose an enounter and if will be indentified on a map.
